        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I'm passionate about language and the art of expression.
            I'm dedicated to creative work across both material and
            visual media—for example, print design, logo design,
            and conceptualization. I value creative freedom and
            expression through detailed, passionate, and intricate work.

        <h3>Freelance Creative Designer</h3>

        <p>
            I worked on product design, combining traditional craftsmanship,
            model making, and the creative application of concepts and ideas.
            I focused on implementing storytelling into artistic work through
            sketches and visual concepts—such as illustration and drawing—and
            designing with various materials. I also incorporate theory such
            as conventional design principles and color theory.
